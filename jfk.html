      <h1 id="whokilledkennedy">Who Killed Kennedy?</h1>

      <p>Ever since JFK's assassination on November 22, 1963, America has been rife with conspiracy theories. Some, such as the Warren Commission, purport that the killer was Lee Harvey Oswald, who acted alone. They claim that Oswald fired three shots at the president: the first went through the president's neck and also hit Governor Connally, the second was the one that hit his head, and third was a complete miss. However, many Americans realize that this sequence of events is impossible. For the first shot to have hit both the president and the governor in the trajectory claimed, it would have had to make multiple right turns in mid air<a href="#1">[1]</a>, an obvious impossibility for any normal gun. Obviously, there must have been some sort of conspiracy. Even the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded in 1979 that Kennedy was "probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy"<a href="#2">[2]</a>. The reality is that it was the CIA who planned and executed the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p>

      <p>This theory is supported by the fact that there were three tramps on the grassy knoll that the president's car was passing by as he was shot. However, all three men were clean-shaven and well dressed, unbefitting of the status of tramp. The reason is that they were not tramps at all -- they were secret CIA assassins, there to act in case Oswald was unable to finish the job. In case there is still doubt, a released document on the CIA website literally has the title: "MAFIA AND CIA LINKED IN JFK MURDER"<a href="#3">[3]</a></p>

      <p>So why did the CIA want Kennedy killed? It was partly because Kennedy wanted to dismantle the CIA. He was quoted as saying he wanted to "splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds"<a href="#4">[4]</a> after the failed Bay of Pigs debacle. But why would only this cause the CIA to plan an assassination of their own president? The fact is that they were under orders from their true masters, the Illuminati.</p>

      <p>The Illuminati, as everyone knows, is the secret shadow government that rules behind-the-scenes. The reason they wanted JFK dead is that he wanted to end the Vietnam war, which was making the shadow bankers tons of money. They were also angered by Kennedey's attempts to rein in the power of the US Federal Reserve, such as with the issuing of Executive Order 11110<a href="#5">[5]</a>, which obviously is a prominent Illuminati organization (why else would they have a pyramid with an eye on the back of the dollar bill?).</p>

      <p>So back to the magic bullet theory. Obviously it is impossible with human technology. This is why the Illuminati enlisted the help of aliens to develop extra-terrestrial technology which would allow a bullet to turn in mid-air. The aliens agreed to develop this technology because Kennedy was wanting to expose their existence. Just ten days before his death, JFK wrote a secret memo to the CIA (already conspiring his death) demanding files on UFOs<a href="#6">[6]</a>. When the CIA alerted the aliens about JFK's intentions, they agreed to help build the magic bullet.</p>

      <p>So how does Lee Harvey Oswald fit into this? He was the one who shot Kennedy using the magic bullet provided by the aliens. The CIA communicated to Oswald their plan to kill Kennedy through none other than Rafael Cruz, Ted Cruz's father! There is a picture clearly showing Cruz exchanging leaflets with Oswald just months before JFK's murder<a href="#7">[7]</a>. It was obviously during this time that Cruz told Oswald the CIA's plan of assassinating JFK. If there is any remaining doubt, during an interview with USA Today, Ted Cruz was quoted as saying "I guess I should go ahead and admit yes my dad killed JFK"<a href="#8">[8]<a>.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the CIA planned and executed the assassination of John F. Kennedy, acting under orders of the Illuminati as well as their own motives, using alien technology for a magic bullet, and working with Rafael Cruz to communicate to Lee Harvey Oswald the assassination plan. To cover everything up, the CIA claimed the release of documents about the murder would "threaten national security"<a href="#9">[9]</a>. They also orchestrated the murder of Oswald himself, to keep him from spilling any secrets about the true nature of President John F. Kennedy's assassination.</p>
